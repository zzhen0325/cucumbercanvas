# Canvas Design Skill — Integration & Verification Guide

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed locally
- `pip install pillow reportlab`
- Font files in `skills/canvas-design/canvas-fonts/`

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local additions
CUCUMBER_SANDBOX_ROOT=/tmp/cucumber-sandbox-dev
CUCUMBER_SKILLS_ROOT=./skills
```

### Verification Steps

1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Open a project in the web UI
3. Send message: "帮我生成一张极简主义风格的海报"
4. Verify:
   - Agent activates canvas-design skill (check server logs for `[SkillsMiddleware]`)
   - Agent calls `execute` tool with Python code
   - Generated PNG appears in sandbox tmpdir
   - Agent calls `persist_sandbox_file` to upload
   - User receives downloadable URL
   - Sandbox tmpdir cleaned up after run

### Production Deployment

The Dockerfile handles everything:
- Python + Pillow + reportlab installed in image
- Skills + fonts copied to `/opt/cucumber/skills/`
- Default env vars work out of the box

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `execute` tool not available | Backend not sandbox | Check `CUCUMBER_AGENT_BACKEND_MODE=state` and backend factory returns LocalShellBackend |
| Fonts not found | Wrong FONT_DIR | Check `CUCUMBER_SKILLS_ROOT` env var |
| Sandbox dir fills up | Cleanup failed | Check runtime.ts finally block; add cron cleanup as safety net |
| Python not found | Not in Docker image | Rebuild Docker image |
| Skill not discovered | Skills path misconfigured | Check `/skills/` route in CompositeBackend |

### Adding New Skills

Place new skills in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. They are automatically
discovered by SkillsMiddleware on next agent run. No code changes needed.
